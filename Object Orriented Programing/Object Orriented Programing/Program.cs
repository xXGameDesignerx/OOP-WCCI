//OOP
//Object Orriented Programing
//4 pillars of OOP - Abstraction, Polymorphism, inheritance, encapsulation
//outline classes and objects at a macro level. Also outlines the features and relationships of clases and objects.
//objects: tangale items we can use/create. Also instances of classes.
//instances: objects are specific examples of classes.
//Properties: objects that are refrenced based on specific characteristics
//Method: functions used and manipulate the characteristics of the specific object.
//difference between methods and properties: both use dot operator, but properties use a parentheses after the method name. Methods do not use parentheses.
// property: ex. names.Count;
// method: ex. names.MyMethod();


//Classes
//object types.
//Classes outline what properties and methods a particular object will have at its fingertips.


//Classes vs. objects
